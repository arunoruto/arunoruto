# Hi there 👋

### Work & Research
I am currently working on my research regarding light scattering using the T-matrix method.
This will be mainly portrayed in my current project [YASF](https://github.com/AGBV/YASF).

### Learning
No matter how well-versed you are in a language, there will always be a new language lurking around the corner to get your attention with some shiny features...
I worked with Matlab quite a lot, but due to the closed-source nature, I familiarized myself with Python 🐍.
But since I am a mathematician deep down, I am getting tempted to switch to Julia. And who knows, maybe my light scattering code will be ported there 👀

If I am not at my desk (at work or home), you can probably find me collecting scrapes in the closest climbing gym!\
